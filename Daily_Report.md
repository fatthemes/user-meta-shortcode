Work Done-
Added plugin with custom block from scratch

Query -
In the initial email, you had mentioned about using select or dropbox component for the user to choose which meta data to display. But that would allow only one option to be selected. Is that what you would prefer? Only one option, or would you prefer multiple? Also, does the user refers to the person adding the block to the post? I will add the component accordingly.

September 9th, 2021

Work Done -
1. Checked out Gutenberg form plugin as the form builder for site. It has been especially designed for working with Gutenberg editor and can be used to easily build forms.  Unfortunately, I could not figure out how to retrieve that data using code to utilise it
2. Built php form with checkboxes for the display. It will need to be further merged with other codes to obtain user metadata.
3. Looked into CSS and Javascript for WordPress

Queries -
Do you want only custom written php plugins for functionality? or are you open to mixing existing plugins, and using a combination of CSS and JavaScript to show and hide elements? Another way to implement the objective can be simply adding hide buttons for each data field and hiding the data when it is clicked. I am not sure if we can get the same functionality in WordPress, but I would look into it.

September 8th, 2021

Work done -
1. Checked the Gutenberg example repository
2. Checking the existing plugins for required functions to incorporate/ modify them for required functionality
3. Working on writing a custom plugin for WordPress

Work plan -
1. For checkboxes - basic php code incorporated in a plugin with shortcode, look for plugins that provide checkboxes for users to select
2. For getting User Data - user-meta-shortcode file or some variation of it, or custom program with get_user_data() to access individual fields
3. Merging them so that only those data fields are displayed that the user checked themselves

September 7th, 2021

Work done -
1. Checked all links sent
2. Logged into WordPress account and explored the test page
3. Forked and cloned the git repository
4. Looked into shortcodes and block editor
5. Looking into writing WordPress plugins and shortcodes to better understand the user_meta_shortcode file as well as how to edit it to get desired results.
6. Installed WordPress locally in my system so I can see the effects of the changes made in the plugin file without affecting the original WordPress site.

Issues -
1. Cannot open DB GUI and SFTP
   But I decided to look into it later and focus more on what is working right now - the WordPress site and plugin code.

Queries/Requests

It will take me a while to get used to shortcode and WordPress plugins. I will get to editing/writing new code as soon as I get the hang of WordPress first. It might take a couple of days, so I hope it is not a problem.
